                <p>&emsp;&emsp;"This dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

                Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies.

                <hr>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The rating-based algorithm was run on a subset using each of the following restrictions to achieve the most accurate recommendations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recommend only Movies with at least 20 or 50 reviews</li>
                    <li>Use Ratings only from users that provided at least 50 or 100 ratings</li>
                    <li>Recommend only Movies with at least 50 reviews from users that provided at least 50 ratings</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <br>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Data was manipulated to create multiple subsets matching the restrictions above. In every case, using the subsets listed
                provided poorer and less diverse recommendations than using the full 100,000 ratings of 10,000 movies. This disparity was unexpected when
                developing Movie Recommender. It appears that having the many (almost 5,000) movies with 3 reviews or less, still contributes significantly
                to the overall accuracy of the rating-based recommender engine. By having a much broader set of movies (vectors) to choose from, the algorithm is able to
                fit a better, closer match to the user movie provided.</p>
